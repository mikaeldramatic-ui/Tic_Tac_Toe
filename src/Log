Solve the issues with !inbounds an other errors like isFull and scanner error.
Runned the game and it worked.
Iv'e alo added DialogManager and DialogEvent for some "trash talk" in game.

Ive recently found an error when it comes to the game.
If i play on easy mode , normal or hard it dosen't change to those levels. its the same default.
On easy you if only 2 in a row from row 0 and row 1, row 2 gets a win.
And also ive founded that if im playing on "normal" , it will not end the game when Ive got
three in a row dosen't end the game.
And on hard you also wins with 2 in a row from 0,0 and 1,0.

Need to find out what happens in code

Solved with Ai's code

Solved also problems with Board.java with help of Ai's code

Ive recently found out that I needed to add methods like quit game, change row or colon when its full or square is taken.
Resolved and also added a extra player (player 2) and write name

See if theres more to add or change later on....
