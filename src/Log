Still having problems with !inBounds that keeps getting problems, wonder why.

Solve the issues with !inbounds an other errors like isFull and scanner error.
Runned the game and it worked.
Iv'e alo added DialogManager and DialogEvent for some "trash talk" in game.

Ive recently found an error when it comes to the game.
If i play on easy mode , normal or hard it dosen't change to those levels. its the same default.
On easy you if only 2 in a row from row 0 and row 1, row 2 gets a win.
And also ive founded that if im playing on "normal" , it will not end the game when Ive got
three in a row dosen't end the game.
And on hard you also wins with 2 in a row from 0,0 and 1,0.

Need to find out what happens in code

Solved with Ai's code

Solved also problems with Board.java with help of Ai's code

Ive recently found out that I needed to add methods like quit game, change row or colon when its full or square is taken.
Resolved and also added a extra player (player 2) and write name

See if theres more to add or change later on....

I changed my mind wih the dialogevent BLOCK, it dosen't feel it's function and im using more Pre Move so can say more cheecky
stuff.

Im going to try to add a wlecome sign and see if i Can get a good game story.

Once more i've got error on GameController.java and ended up with error on StoryManager also.
Ive also created HighScoreManager with help of ai,
 can save .txt for more higscore feeling and sharing how many vicotries and time.

Daytime, Ive check every class , enum and run the program couple of times, some few adjustments for both code and terminal, everything runs
perfectly and also removed every //writing text I did for help on the road.
Now im going to send it in.
Couldn't understand how to package my files that i can have game package, dialog, enums etc etc...
Will try to speak with my teacher later on.
